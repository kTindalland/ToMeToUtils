# ToMeToUtils
ToMeToUtils for python development

Created as a joint effort between the Sixth Form Computer Science students.

Rules:
  - If you edit, please create a seperate branch and give it an appropriate name and description. Then when the addition is finished,
  please request it to be pulled into the master branch.
  - When creating a new branch, please give the name a prefix such as 'AddingClass-[className]' or 'AddingFunction-[functionName]' to
  make it easier to keep track of what each branch is doing.
  - Once a branch is pulled into the master branch, it will be deleted.
